12 |     let builder = UserBuilder::default().email(String::from("jon@example.com"));
   |         ------- move occurs because `builder` has type `UserBuilder`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
13 |     let user = builder.build(10, String::from("Jon"));
   |                ------- value moved here
...
19 |     let user = builder.build(11, String::from("Jon2"));
   |                ^^^^^^^ value used here after move
